Project Description
iOS Crypography project  is another effort to secure and encyrpt your data on the go(over https/TCP) that focuses on ease of use for developers to ecrypt data on the go in Mobile/Watch or any other iOS device. 
There is seperate code based for Android which I will publish in another repo

Main Features
iOS Crypography is libaray stype APIs which you can use to pass payload and it will be encrypted and you send encrypted values over https or from different devices like Android/iOS.
AutoMocking - Easily configure and verify behavior.
Clean Separation of Test State - Encapsulate test setup and reuse it across as many specs as you like. Run The Same Specs Multiple Times With Different Contexts - 
You can use different encryption techniques like RSA2, HSA etc.
IT provides you options to encrypt and decrypt messages using Public key and Private key crypto graphy. 
It is exposed as libaray so any Mobile devloper can use in their App for iOS/Java. 
Place where this library is used : Mobile app by Operators/Managers on AirPort.
